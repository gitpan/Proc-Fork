Proc::Fork version 0.05
=================

DESCRIPTION

Proc::Fork provides a simple interface to the fork() system call.

 child
 {
     # child code goes here.
 }
 parent
 {
     my $child_pid = shift;
     # parent code goes here.
     waitpid $child, 0;
 }
 error
 {
     # Error-handling code goes here (if fork() fails).
 };

If the error block is omitted, it defaults to causing the program to
die.  If the parent or child block is omitted, control in the parent
or child process (respectively) passes to the code following the
block.


INSTALLATION

To install this module, do the standard Perl module four-step:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEVELOPMENT STATE

This is beta software, hence the 0.x version number.  The author has
done performed various tests; however, it hasn't been used (to my
knowledge) in any heavy-duty production systems.  So be careful out
there.  If you do put this module through its paces, I'd appreciate it
if you'd drop me a line and let me know how it did.


DEPENDENCIES

None.  Well, Carp.pm, but that comes with Perl.
